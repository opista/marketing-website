## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are you collecting my data?

No! Your personal data is never sent to us.

### Why haven't Avios appeared in my account after a purchase?

Please make sure that you aren't blocking cookies! These are important to ensure that Avios and the retailer can link the purchase to your account. This won't resolve missing Avios for existing purchases, but Avios offer the ability to claim for missing Avios [here](https://shopping.ba.com/my-account/missing-avios/).

If that doesn't solve your issue for future purchases, Avios offer more suggestions on their [Help page](https://www.avios.com/en-GB/help).
