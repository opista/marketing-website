title: iPod Classic Modding Guide
description: Your complete guide to modding iPod Classic (5th-7th gen). Explore storage, battery, and other hardware upgrades, plus software tips and fixes.
---

<TableOfContents />

## Introduction

This guide collects insights into modding the iPod Classic **(5th, 6th, and 7th generation)**. I originally created it to collate the information I gathered during my own iPod modding journey. Think of this as a helpful starting point: it's not a complete, step-by-step manual, but it offers valuable resources and should help you get started with confidence.

<Alert type="info">You'll find that some of the details in this guide come from other websites. I've made sure to reference every source, as my goal is to bring together and preserve this information in one convenient place.</Alert>

## Identify your iPod model

Information gathered from various sources[^yuuiko_guide][^apple_support_identify_model] around the web. Select the model that matches your iPod, or answer the questions to identify it if you're not sure.

<IpodIdentifier />


## Opening your iPod

It's relatively simple to open an iPod. However, people notoriously struggle[^reddit_6_gen_cant_open][^reddit_7_gen_cant_open] to open the 6th/7th generation models due to the metal front and back. If you know what you're doing, you should be able to get at the internals within a few minutes.

The iPod has **11** clips holding the front and back together. You'll need to disengage these clips with your pry tool (iSesamo or alternative) to access the internals.

YouTuber [Geek Detour](https://www.youtube.com/@GeekDetour) has created a <Link href="/posts/ipod-modding/documents/opening-ipod-reference.pdf" openInNewTab>reference card</Link>[^youtuber_geekdetour_reference_pdf] that you can print out to identify where the internal clips are.

<Alert type="error">It's important that you slide your pry tool **downwards** to disengage the clips. **DO NOT PUSH OUTWARDS!** Pushing the tool in other directions can cause unnecessary damage to the device housing.</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">The battery ribbon cable is very delicate and can be easily damaged. Be careful not to pull the front faceplate away too quickly or with too much force once the clips are disengaged.</Alert>

## Core hardware upgrades

### Storage mod

Storage mods are quite simple to perform. However, you must consider:

* Which generation iPod you have
* Which other mods you're looking to implement

The answers to these questions will steer your choices when determining your storage adaptor.

#### Device storage limits

There are a few different limitations on the maximum storage capacity of iPods[^dcg_capacity_guide] running the stock operating system.

A database of your iPod's files is loaded into RAM. A <RamIndicator ram={32} /> iPod has a limit of around 20,000 items (songs, videos, etc.), whilst the <RamIndicator ram={64} /> models have a limit of around 50,000. If you're not sure how much RAM your device has, use the [iPod identifier](#identify-your-ipod-model).

You should also be aware that some generations (specifically 6/6.5) have a hard storage limit. However, you can [flash newer firmware](#bypassing-6th-generation-storage-limits) to bypass this.

Check out the compatibility table below for more details.

<Accordion title="Storage upgrade compatibility table"><IpodStorageUpgradeCompatibilityTable /></Accordion>

<Alert type="info">Looking to bypass these stock OS limits? You'll have to install Rockbox.[^reddit_rockbox_storage_limit] Check out [Installing Rockbox](#installing-rockbox) for more information.</Alert>

#### Storage adaptor options

There are a number of adaptors of varying prices and configurations. The table below outlines the most common choices with pros and cons. The adaptors are in preference order.[^youtube_storage_adaptors_ranked] Higher is better.

<Alert type="info">My preference is the iFlash Î¼Dual. It gives you space for further mods, and you can dispose of a large portion of the adaptor to reduce the footprint. I would **avoid** mSata due to its high power consumption[^iflash_adaptor_analysis] (Around **2x** the consumption of the original HDD, and **4.5x** the iFlash SD options)</Alert>

<Accordion title="Storage adaptor comparison table"><IpodStorageAdaptorOptionsTable /></Accordion>

### Battery mod

Replacing the battery on your iPod is one of the easier mods, and is often the first mod people perform. If you are looking to **increase** your iPod's battery capacity, the battery will need to be physically larger. Due to limited space inside the iPod, you have limited options:

1. If the iPod has a <BackplateIndicator backplate="thin" /> backplate, replace it was a <BackplateIndicator backplate="thick" /> backplate. This will give you more space for a larger battery behind the HDD.
1. Remove the HDD and upgrade the storage (Check out [storage mods](#storage-mod) for more info). This will free up space for the battery, and allow you to use a <BackplateIndicator backplate="thin" /> backplate. This is the recommended path, as the stock HDDs are old and eventually fail anyway.

#### Battery & Storage Compatibility

Not all batteries are the same. Due to the variance in their dimensions (width, height, depth), you may find yourself trying to install a battery that doesn't fit into your device. 

<BackplateIndicator backplate="thick" /> backplate iPods have the extra depth to accommodate all battery & storage combinations. 

<BackplateIndicator backplate="thin" /> backplate iPods have less space, and therefore choice is more limited.  

This table should help guide you on which battery to choose.[^youtube_battery_iflash_guide]

<Accordion title="Battery & iFlash compatibility table">

<Alert type="info">If you're not sure which storage adaptor is which, check out [Storage adaptor options](#storage-adaptor-options) for a more detailed description.</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">All battery measurements provided (Height x Width x Depth) are taken directly from batteries ordered from the provided links, and should be taken as approximations. Always check the measurements of the batteries you order</Alert> 

<IpodStorageBatteryCompatibilityTable />

</Accordion>

#### Identifying battery dimensions

Batteries should have a 6-digit code printed on their front which can be used to identify their dimensions. For example, the code `785239` can be broken down to 78mm width, 52mm height, 3.9mm depth.

<Alert type="warning">Pay attention to listings when looking for batteries on AliExpress. The label, image, and descriptions often show different dimensions on the same listing. Be sure to check thoroughly and look at reviews to ensure that you're buying the correct product.</Alert>

#### Replacing the battery

You'll need to [open your iPod](#opening-your-ipod) first. Then, follow the video guide below for battery replacement.

<Accordion title="Video guide"><YoutubeEmbed start={373} videoId="4AF1Pjbwc6c" /></Accordion>

## Cosmetic mods

There is a widely held belief[^reddit_faceplates_single_factory_1] that all aftermarket faceplates and backplates come from the same factory in China. I did my own digging into this, and although there are multiple traders on *AliExpress* who sell them, I believe that almost all have been sourced from a single company found on *Alibaba*: [Shenzhen Hyperion Lighting Co., Ltd.](https://hyperion.en.alibaba.com/productgrouplist-801920784/Parts_for_iPod.html)

There are multiple resellers who also sell them (EOE, Parts Plus Pods, etc.), but as all the parts are coming from the same factory, the quality is likely to be the same. EOE themselves have commented that all aftermarket parts are made by one factory[^reddit_eoe_parts_single_factory], which includes their own products. **Resellers are not a guarantee of quality.**


### Faceplate mod

6th/7th gen faceplates are metal and therefore better quality and more durable.

With the 5th gen faceplates, many users have reported quality control issues. The plastic is easily scratched,[^reddit_faceplates_5_gen_scratched_1][^reddit_faceplates_5_gen_scratched_2] screw holes can be misaligned,[^reddit_faceplates_5_gen_misaligned_screws_1][^reddit_faceplates_5_gen_misaligned_screws_2][^reddit_faceplates_5_gen_misaligned_screws_3] and the clickwheel can be misaligned too.[^reddit_faceplates_5_gen_clickwheel_misaligned_1][^reddit_faceplates_5_gen_clickwheel_misaligned_2]


<Accordion title="Example faceplates">
This list isn't exhaustive, but is a sample of most available faceplates
<IpodFaceplateOptionsTable />
</Accordion>

#### Replacing the faceplate

You'll need to [open your iPod](#opening-your-ipod) first. Then, follow the video guide below.

<Accordion title="Video guide"><YoutubeEmbed start={373} videoId="4AF1Pjbwc6c" /></Accordion>


### Backplate mod

<WorkInProgress />

## Advanced mods

These mods are typically more complex than battery or storage mods which are mostly swapping parts. These mods will require soldering wires to parts of your iPod's circuit board. Therefore **you will need a soldering iron and wires**. 

### Bluetooth mod

<Alert type="warning">When installing a Bluetooth board within the device, be aware of a recurring issue[^reddit_bluetooth_range_1][^reddit_bluetooth_range_2] with range. The iPod's screen shield and metal casing can act as a Faraday cage, potentially impairing wireless performance. This effect should be factored into your modification plans.</Alert>

There are a few routes that you can take when implementing a Bluetooth mod. Each of these approaches focuses on a different method of interacting with the Bluetooth board. In theory, you could swap out the Bluetooth transmitter that each guide uses in favour of one you prefer. However, you may need to make adjustments for it to work.

#### Oxyll's "elegant Bluetooth" mod

<RecommendedBadge />

This is the most technically complex mod, but in my opinion the most preferrable. There are no visible changes to the hardware, and Bluetooth connection is managed via the clickwheel.

Oxyll has <Link href="/posts/ipod-modding/documents/oxyll-bluetooth-mod.pdf" openInNewTab>produced an incredibly detailed guide</Link>[^oxyll_bluetooth_mod] that covers everything you need to know about this mod, including the parts you'll need, how it works, and how to integrate your Bluetooth adaptor.

#### IcyEgg-9339's "Right Way" mod

<Alert type="warning">Although functionality of your iPod will remain the same, this does require you to remove one of the screws securing your lock switch to the backplate so that it can be pressed against an internal switch. Continued pressing of the lock switch **could** weaken the part over time.</Alert> 

<Alert type="info">This mod has maximum space for a 2000mAh (square) battery when placed within a <BackplateIndicator backplate="thin" /> backplate.</Alert>

[IcyEgg-9339's Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1kztic2/the_right_way_to_bluetooth_mod_your_ipod_classic/) isn't the first demonstration of this approach, however there has been some chatter about it on Reddit recently, and the author [gave plenty of details](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1kztic2/comment/mw3uks1/) for users to get started. 

With this mod, you'll affix a button below the lock switch, which you can then press or hold to manage Bluetooth. This means that you're still able to use the lock switch as you did before, with additional functionality.

It uses the board from a [UGREEN CM672 Bluetooth adaptor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Connection-Headphone/dp/B0CJY56XG3), which is compatible with AirPods Pro 2[^amazon_review_airpods_pro_2_ugreen_cm672].

#### Parts Plus Pods Bluetooth mod

<Alert type="error">Although all of these mods require some level of destructive work, this particular approach repurposes the lock switch as a pairing button for Bluetooth. **Your lock switch will no longer lock your device. It requires you to cut the flex cable connecting the headphone jack to the lock switch.** </Alert>

This mod is the cheapest option, because the KCX_BT_EMITTER board is less than Â£1. However, you could always replace this with a different Bluetooth board if you understand how to wire it up. 

The [Parts Plus Pods](https://www.youtube.com/@partspluspods3689) YouTube channel has multiple videos demonstrating how to implement this mod. If you would prefer not to do this mod yourself, [their store also sells "kits"](https://partspluspods.com.au/product/bluetooth-upgrade-kit-for-apple-ipod-classic-5th-gen/) at a reasonable price which have Bluetooth and an upgraded battery.

### Rockbox

<Alert type="warning">Installing Rockbox will bypass the usual iPod [storage limits](#device-storage-limits); however, there will still be a 2TB limit enforced by the FAT32 file-system.[^dcg_capacity_guide]</Alert>

#### Is Rockbox right for me?[^discord_ipod_community_faq_rockbox]

If you have ever thought the following:
- I want to drag and drop music, no iTunes!
- I want to theme the UI!
- I want games and emulators!
- I want to play FLACs!

**Rockbox is for you.**

If you have ever thought the following:
- I'm ok with iTunes!
- I want less hassle with getting album art to show up!
- I want smooth animations of the stock UI!
- I donât want bloat in my firmware!

**iPodOS is for you.**

#### Installing Rockbox

Installing Rockbox is a straightforward procedure. Check out the video guide below for the setup steps. 

<Accordion title="Software checklist">
* iTunes 12.10.11.2 (newer versions won't work)
  * [Windows 32bit](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/itunes12/001-80042-20210422-E8A351F2-A3B2-11EB-9A8F-CF1B67FC6302/iTunesSetup.exe)

<Alert type="info">Want to boot back into iPodOS? Perform a [force restart](#force-restart), and once the screen goes blank, flip the lockswitch **on**.</Alert>

### Installing games

Reddit user [Olsro](https://www.reddit.com/user/OlsroFR/)[^reddit_user_olsro_donate] (again!) has started [a project to preserve iPod games](https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject). Follow the guide there to install (almost) all of the original iPod games on your device.

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Debugging

#### Force restart[^apple_support_force_restart]

1. Put the Hold switch firmly in the unlocked position.
1. Press and hold the Menu and Select (Centre) buttons for 8 seconds, or until you see the Apple logo.

#### DFU Mode[^apple_wiki_dfu_mode]

1. Connect the device to a computer using a USB cable.
1. Hold down both the Select (Centre) and Menu button.
1. The device will reboot. Keep holding both buttons.
1. After 8 seconds, release both buttons.


#### Disk mode[^apple_support_disk_mode]

1. Set your iPod on a flat surface and make sure your iPod has a battery charge.
1. Slide the Hold switch on and off.
1. Perform a [force restart](#force-restart).
1. Press and hold the Select (Centre) and Play/Pause buttons until you see the disk mode screen. Make sure you press the Play/Pause buttons towards the outside of the click wheel and not near the centre.
1. Connect your iPod to your computer. The screen on your iPod should display Do not disconnect. Make sure you eject your iPod in iTunes before you disconnect it from your computer.

#### Debug mode[^ifixit_debug_mode]

1. Perform a [force restart](#force-restart).
1. Immediately after the Apple logo appears, hold down the Previous Track and Select (Centre) buttons.
1. The screen should display the Apple logo. Once the screen turns white, it is safe to release the two buttons.

#### Checking HDD Health

Sometimes your iPod can begin to act strangely or sluggish. Album artwork may disappear, it may struggle to load songs, or report back that your storage capacity is much lower than it should be. These can often be an indication that your HDD health is declining.

The iPod itself offers a diagnostic "HDSMARTData" report to gather some stats on your HDD. To do this follow the steps below:

1. Put your iPod into [debug mode](#debug-mode)
1. Press Menu for "Manual Test"
1. Select "IO"
1. Select "HardDrive"
1. Select "HDSMARTData"

This will run a [S.M.A.R.T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes) report on your iPod's HDD. We care about the **Retracts**, **Reallocs**, and **Pending Sectors**. Check out the below table for details on what those mean.

<Accordion title="S.M.A.R.T attribute glossary">

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Power-off Retract Count (Retracts) | The number of power-off or emergency retract cycles. **Lower is better**. |
| Current Pending Sector Count (Pending Sectors) | A count of bad sectors that have been found and re-mapped. **Lower is better**. |
| Reallocated Sectors Count (Reallocs) | Count of reallocated sectors. The raw value represents a count of the bad sectors that have been found and remapped. Thus, the higher the attribute value, the more sectors the drive has had to reallocate. This value is primarily used as a metric of the life expectancy of the drive; a drive which has had any reallocations at all is significantly more likely to fail in the immediate months. **Lower is better**. |

</Accordion>

**Reallocs** will have an upper threshold before total drive failure. We don't know what this value is for an iPod hard drive, but if the number you see isn't 0, it is significantly more likely to fail. If you're noticing issues and see a high count, it may be easier to replace the drive. Check out [Storage mod](#storage-mod) for more information.

### FAQ

#### My screen shows a circled red X and a support link, what's happened?

<Image alt="iPod Classic circled red cross error" height={238} src="/posts/ipod-modding/faq/red-cross-support.png" width={318} />

This usually means a hard drive failure.[^apple_community_hard_drive_issue] You can confirm this by putting the iPod into [debug mode](#debug-mode) and checking the hard drive status. Possible issues:

1. The hard drive is not connected properly.
1. The connector is damaged.
1. The hard drive is damaged or has failed.

#### Can I put an 6th/7th gen faceplate on my 5th generation iPod?

Yes. However, you'll also need to transplant 6th/7th gen parts:

* The midframe.
* (optional) The clickwheel **plastic**. You can skip this, but if you do, the clickwheel won't sit flush with the faceplate.[^reddit_5_gen_7_gen_faceplate_1][^reddit_5_gen_7_gen_faceplate_2][^reddit_5_gen_7_gen_faceplate_3] This [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1IRfKDwoXc) should help you understand how to do this. As you can see, the centre of the plastic wheel has a slightly increased depth.

<Image alt="Demonstrating the difference in depth of clickwheel plastic" height={1230} src="/posts/ipod-modding/faq/clickwheel-depth.jpg" width={2048} />

#### I've added music to my iPod, and now it's slow/crashes when I turn it on

You're probably nearing or have reached the maximum number of songs your iPod can handle. <RamIndicator ram={32} /> models are limited to around 20,000 songs, whilst <RamIndicator ram={64} /> models are limited to around 50,000. [Identify your iPod model](#identify-your-ipod-model) to understand your device's limits.

#### I've tried to check my SMART data and I see "Error"

This is likely a faulty hard drive. If the device is modded, check that ribbon connections are seated correctly. If it's not modded, you will need to replace the drive. Check [Storage mod](#storage-mod) for more information.

#### I've checked my SMART data because my iPod is behaving strangely. What is "bad"?

Read the [Checking HDD Health](#checking-hdd-health) section for information on what your SMART report means.

#### My clickwheel centre button isn't working

The foam pad behind the clickwheel can shift out of alignment, preventing the button from clicking in correctly.

You'll need to [disassemble your iPod](#opening-your-ipod) and recentre (or replace) the foam pad[^youtube_clickwheel_not_working]. As you can see in the image below, there is a black foam pad over each button. Ensure that these are centred.

<Image alt="iPod internal board" className="max-w-full sm:max-w-sm" height={1014} src="/posts/ipod-modding/faq/ipod-board.png" width={1080} />

#### I installed Rockbox and can't get back to iPodOS

You can access iPodOS by performing a [force restart](#force-restart), and once the screen goes blank, flip the lockswitch **on**.

#### There's a black mark on my screen, what is it?

<Alert type="error">**Stop using your iPod and don't charge it anymore if you have a black mark on the screen.** It is a potential hazard and the battery needs to be disposed of properly!</Alert>

This is usually caused by the battery swelling behind the screen, creating a pressure spot. Batteries can swell because of physical damage, defects, or just age (the most common for these devices). The best course of action is to properly dispose of the battery, and replace it with a new one. Check out the [Battery mod](#battery-mod) section to guide you on replacement.
