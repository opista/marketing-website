description: Your complete guide to modding iPod Classic (5th-7th gen). Explore storage, battery, and other hardware upgrades, plus software tips and fixes.
---

<TableOfContents />

## Introduction

This guide collects insights into modding the iPod Classic **(5th, 6th, and 7th generation)**. I originally created it to collate the information I gathered during my own iPod modding journey. Think of this as a helpful starting point: it's not a complete, step-by-step manual, but it offers valuable resources and should help you get started with confidence.

<Alert type="info">You'll find that some of the details in this guide come from other websites. I've made sure to reference every source, as my goal is to bring together and preserve this information in one convenient place.</Alert>


## Necessary equipment

A basic list of items to gain access to your iPod's internals. Equipment needed for specific mods will be listed in their respective sections.

<IpodEquipmentTable />

## Identify your iPod model

Information gathered from various sources[^yuuiko_guide][^apple_support_identify_model] around the web. Select the model that matches your iPod, or answer the questions to identify it if you're not sure.

<IpodIdentifier />


## Opening your iPod

It's relatively simple to open an iPod. However, people notoriously struggle[^reddit_7_gen_cant_open] to open the 6th/7th generation models due to the metal front and back. If you know what you're doing, you should be able to get at the internals within a few minutes.

The iPod has **11** clips holding the front and back together. You'll need to disengage these clips with your pry tool (iSesamo or alternative) to access the internals.

YouTuber [Geek Detour](https://www.youtube.com/@GeekDetour) has created a <Link href="/posts/ipod-modding/documents/opening-ipod-reference.pdf" openInNewTab>reference card</Link>[^youtuber_geekdetour_reference_pdf] that you can print out to identify where the internal clips are.

<Accordion title="Video guide"><YoutubeEmbed videoId="a3gPf6obQHs" /></Accordion>

<Alert type="error">It's important that you slide your pry tool **downwards** to disengage the clips. **DO NOT PUSH OUTWARDS!** Pushing the tool in other directions can cause unnecessary damage to the device housing.</Alert>


## Storage mod

Storage mods are quite simple to perform. However, you must consider:

* Which generation iPod you have
* Which other mods you're looking to implement

The answers to these questions will steer your choices when determining your storage adaptor.

### Device storage limits

There are a few different limitations on the maximum storage capacity of iPods[^dcg_capacity_guide] running the stock operating system.

A database of your iPod's files is loaded into RAM. A <RamIndicator ram={32} /> iPod has a limit of around 20,000 items (songs, videos, etc.), whilst the <RamIndicator ram={64} /> models have a limit of around 50,000. If you're not sure how much RAM your device has, use the [iPod identifier](#identify-your-ipod-model).

You should also be aware that some generations (specifically 6/6.5) have a hard storage limit. However, you can [flash newer firmware](#bypassing-6th-generation-storage-limits) to bypass this.

Check out the compatibility table below for more details.

<Accordion title="Storage upgrade compatibility table"><IpodStorageUpgradeCompatibilityTable /></Accordion>

<Alert type="info">Looking to bypass these stock OS limits? You'll have to install Rockbox.[^reddit_rockbox_storage_limit] Check out [Installing Rockbox](#installing-rockbox) for more information.</Alert>

### Storage adaptor options

There are a number of adaptors of varying prices and configurations. The table below outlines the most common choices with pros and cons. The adaptors are in preference order.[^youtube_storage_adaptors_ranked] Higher is better.

<Alert type="info">My preference is the iFlash Quad. It gives you space for further mods in a thin backplate. I would **avoid** mSata due to its high power consumption[^iflash_adaptor_analysis] (Around **2x** the consumption of the original HDD, and **4.5x** the iFlash SD options)</Alert>

<IpodStorageAdaptorOptionsTable />

## Battery Mod

WIP

### Storage mod compatibility

Not all batteries are the same. Due to the variance in their dimensions (width, height, depth), you may find yourself trying to install a battery that doesn't fit into your device. 

<BackplateIndicator backplate="thick" /> backplate iPods have the extra depth to accommodate all battery & storage combinations. 

<BackplateIndicator backplate="thin" /> backplate iPods have less space, and therefore choice is more limited.  

This table should help guide you on which battery to choose.[^youtube_battery_iflash_guide]

<Accordion title="Battery & iFlash compatibility table">

<Alert type="info">If you're not sure which storage adaptor is which, check out [Storage adaptor options](#storage-adaptor-options) for a more detailed description.</Alert>

<IpodStorageBatteryCompatibilityTable />

</Accordion>

### Identifying battery dimensions

Batteries should have a 6-digit code printed on their front which can be used to identify their dimensions. For example, the code `785239` can be broken down to 78mm width, 52mm height, 3.9mm depth.

<Alert type="warning">Pay attention to listings when looking for batteries on AliExpress. The label, image, and descriptions often show different dimensions on the same listing. Be sure to check thoroughly and look at reviews to ensure that you're buying the correct product.</Alert>

## Bluetooth Mod

<Alert type="warning">When installing a mod within the device, be aware of a recurring issue[^reddit_bluetooth_range_1][^reddit_bluetooth_range_2] with Bluetooth range. The iPod's screen shield and metal casing can create a Faraday cage, potentially impairing wireless performance. This effect should be factored into your modification plans.</Alert>

This mod is much more complicated than the battery or storage mods, and will require soldering wires to parts of your iPod's circuit board. 

There are a few routes that you can take when implementing a Bluetooth mod.

### Oxyll's "elegant Bluetooth" mod

<RecommendedBadge />

<Alert type="info">This is the most technically complex mod, but in my opinion the most preferrable. There are no visible changes to the hardware, and Bluetooth connection is managed via the clickwheel.</Alert>

### IcyEgg-9339's "Right Way" mod

<Alert type="warning">Although functionality of your iPod will remain the same, this does require you to remove one of the screws securing your lock switch to the backplate so that it can be pressed against an internal switch. Continued pressing of the lock switch **could** weaken the part over time.</Alert> 

<Alert type="info">This mod uses a 2000mAh (square) battery in a thin backplate.</Alert>

[IcyEgg-9339's "Right Way" mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1kztic2/the_right_way_to_bluetooth_mod_your_ipod_classic/) isn't the first demonstration of this approach, however there has been some chatter about it on Reddit recently, and the author [gave plenty of details](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1kztic2/comment/mw3uks1/) for users to get started. 

With this mod, you'll affix a button below the lock switch, which you can then press or hold to manage Bluetooth. This means that you're still able to use the lock switch as you did before, with additional functionality.

It uses the board from a [UGREEN CM672 Bluetooth adaptor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Connection-Headphone/dp/B0CJY56XG3), which is compatible with AirPods Pro 2[^amazon_review_airpods_pro_2_ugreen_cm672].

* wires
* max 2000mah battery with this build */}

### Parts Plus Pods Bluetooth mod

<Alert type="error">Although all of these mods require some level of destructive work, this particular approach repurposes the lock switch as a pairing button for Bluetooth. **Your lock switch will no longer lock your device. It requires you to cut the flex cable connecting the headphone jack to the lock switch.** </Alert>

[Parts Plus Pods](https://www.youtube.com/@partspluspods3689) is a channel dedicated to fixing broken iPods. The channel has multiple videos demonstrating how to implement Bluetooth. If you would prefer not to do this mod yourself, [their store also sells "kits"](https://partspluspods.com.au/product/bluetooth-upgrade-kit-for-apple-ipod-classic-5th-gen/) at a reasonable price which have Bluetooth and an upgraded battery.

### Bypassing 6th generation storage limits

Reddit user [Olsro](https://www.reddit.com/user/OlsroFR/)[^reddit_user_olsro_donate] has [produced a guide](https://github.com/Olsro/reddit-ipod-guides/blob/main/guides/ipod6g-flash-more-recent-firmwares.md) on how to flash newer firmware versions onto your device. This means you'll be able to increase the storage on your 6th generation iPod up to 2TB.[^dcg_capacity_guide]

### Rockbox

<Alert type="warning">Installing Rockbox will bypass the usual iPod [storage limits](#device-storage-limits); however, there will still be a 2TB limit enforced by the FAT32 file-system.[^dcg_capacity_guide]</Alert>

WIP

#### Is Rockbox right for me?[^discord_ipod_community_faq_rockbox]

If you have ever thought the following:
- I want to drag and drop music, no iTunes!
- I want to theme the UI!
- I want games and emulators!
- I want to play FLACs!

**Rockbox is for you.**

If you have ever thought the following:
- I'm ok with iTunes!
- I want less hassle with getting album art to show up!
- I want smooth animations of the stock UI!
- I donât want bloat in my firmware!

**iPodOS is for you.**

### Installing games

Reddit user [Olsro](https://www.reddit.com/user/OlsroFR/)[^reddit_user_olsro_donate] (again!) has started [a project to preserve iPod games](https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject). Follow the guide there to install (almost) all of the original iPod games on your device.

### Debugging

#### Force restart[^apple_support_force_restart]

1. Put the Hold switch firmly in the unlocked position.
1. Press and hold the Menu and Select (Centre) buttons for 8 seconds, or until you see the Apple logo.

#### DFU Mode[^apple_wiki_dfu_mode]

1. Connect the device to a computer using a USB cable.
1. Hold down both the Select (Centre) and Menu button.
1. The device will reboot. Keep holding both buttons.
1. After 8 seconds, release both buttons.


#### Disk mode[^apple_support_disk_mode]

1. Set your iPod on a flat surface and make sure your iPod has a battery charge.
1. Slide the Hold switch on and off.
1. Perform a [force restart](#force-restart).
1. Press and hold the Select (Centre) and Play/Pause buttons until you see the disk mode screen. Make sure you press the Play/Pause buttons towards the outside of the click wheel and not near the centre.
1. Connect your iPod to your computer. The screen on your iPod should display Do not disconnect. Make sure you eject your iPod in iTunes before you disconnect it from your computer.

#### Debug mode[^ifixit_debug_mode]

1. Perform a [force restart](#force-restart).
1. Immediately after the Apple logo appears, hold down the Previous Track and Select (Centre) buttons.
1. The screen should display the Apple logo. Once the screen turns white, it is safe to release the two buttons.

## FAQ

### My screen shows a circled red X and a support link, what's happened?

<Image alt="iPod classic circled red cross error" height={238} src="/posts/ipod-modding/red-cross-support.png" width={318} />

This usually means a hard drive failure.[^apple_community_hard_drive_issue] You can confirm this by putting the iPod into [debug mode](#debug-mode) and checking the hard drive status. Possible issues:

1. The hard drive is not connected properly.
1. The connector is damaged.
1. The hard drive is damaged or has failed.

### Can I put an 6th/7th gen faceplate on my 5th generation iPod?

Yes. However, you'll also need to transplant 6th/7th gen parts:

* The midframe.
* (optional) The clickwheel **plastic**. You can skip this, but if you do, the clickwheel won't sit flush with the faceplate.[^reddit_5_gen_7_gen_faceplate_1][^reddit_5_gen_7_gen_faceplate_2][^reddit_5_gen_7_gen_faceplate_3] This [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1IRfKDwoXc) should help you understand how to do this. As you can see, the centre of the plastic wheel has a slightly increased depth.

<Image height={1230} src="/posts/ipod-modding/clickwheel-depth.jpg" width={2048} />

### I've added music to my iPod, and now it's slow/crashes when I turn it on

You're probably nearing or have reached the maximum number of songs your iPod can handle. <RamIndicator ram={32} /> models are limited to around 20,000 songs, whilst <RamIndicator ram={64} /> models are limited to around 50,000. [Identify your iPod model](#identify-your-ipod-model) to understand your device's limits.

### I've tried to check my SMART data and I see "Error"

This is likely a faulty hard drive. If the device is modded, check that ribbon connections are seated correctly. If it's not modded, you will need to replace the drive. Check [Storage mod](#storage-mod) for more information.

### I've checked my SMART data because my iPod is behaving strangely. What is "bad"?

The Wikipedia entry for [S.M.A.R.T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes) tells us everything that we need to know.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Power-off Retract Count (Retracts) | The number of power-off or emergency retract cycles. **Lower is better**. |
| Current Pending Sector Count (Pending Sectors) | A count of bad sectors that have been found and re-mapped. **Lower is better**. |
| Reallocated Sectors Count (Reallocs) | Count of reallocated sectors. The raw value represents a count of the bad sectors that have been found and remapped. Thus, the higher the attribute value, the more sectors the drive has had to reallocate. This value is primarily used as a metric of the life expectancy of the drive; a drive which has had any reallocations at all is significantly more likely to fail in the immediate months. **Lower is better**. |

Reallocs will have an upper threshold before total drive failure. We don't know what this value is for an iPod hard drive, but if the number you see isn't 0, it is significantly more likely to fail. If you're noticing issues and see a high count, it may be easier to replace the drive. Check out [Storage mod](#storage-mod) for more information.

### My clickwheel centre button isn't working

The foam pad behind the clickwheel can shift out of alignment, preventing the button from clicking in correctly.

You'll need to [disassemble your iPod](#opening-your-ipod) and recentre (or replace) the foam pad[^youtube_clickwheel_not_working]. As you can see in the image below, there is a black foam pad over each button. Ensure that these are centred.
